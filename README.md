  <h1>For the One My Heart Will Always Choose</h1>
  <p>My Love,</p>
  <p>This isn’t just another message. This is my digital heartbeat — encoded in words, typed with love, and sent straight to you. Because today, I just want you to know how much I truly, deeply, and endlessly appreciate you.</p>
  <p>Every notification I get from you feels like a spark of sunshine. Kahit simpleng “hi” mo lang, it already makes my day feel complete. You’re more than just my girlfriend — you’re my safe space, my home in a world that often feels too noisy, too fast, too much.</p>
  <p>I don’t always say it, but I notice everything — the way you patiently listen to me even when I barely make sense, the way you support me quietly but consistently, the way you still choose me even when I’m hard to love. You’ve seen parts of me I tried to hide, and you stayed. That… means everything to me.</p>
  <p class="highlight">Thank you.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>For being my peace.</li>
    <li>For being my inspiration.</li>
    <li>For being you.</li
